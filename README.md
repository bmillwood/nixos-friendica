# friendica module for NixOS

Hopefully the options should be relatively self-explanatory. I haven't used the
resulting node much yet, so I'm not sure all functionality is there, but I've
been able to post on it from my admin account.

I suggest not using this module unless you can read and understand all of it,
because I haven't necessarily written it to play nicely with other modules or a
diversity of configurations. Suggestions welcome.

The current available configuration is using Apache and `mod_php`. I plan to
offer at least a `php-fpm`-based configuration, and probably an nginx one.
